Run code faster by creating different child processes with fork and then calling excecv to parent.  Create file in parent, write into file, and then wait for child processes to finish in parent. Once finished, open back up file and compute the average.
Sim.c can run by itself but manager.c needs sim.c in order to run correctly.
